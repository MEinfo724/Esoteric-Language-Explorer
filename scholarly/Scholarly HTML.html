      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        ELAN (Esoteric Language Analysis Network) is a web platform for
        exploring and analyzing esoteric programming languages (esolangs). It
        provides a centralized hub for information, resources, and tools,
        leveraging a conceptual model (ontology/thesaurus) built from existing
        esolang lists like Wikidata.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project offers a SPARQL endpoint for querying the knowledge base,
        enabling detailed information retrieval about esolangs, their features,
        tools, and applications. The platform also recommends esolangs based on
        user preferences, language categories, and pragmatic use cases. ELAN
        aims to make esolangs more accessible for learning, programming,
        research, and general discovery.

        <p>
          ELAN is a web application made with TypeScript, React, Chakra UI, .Net
          Core 8, Azure services, e.g, DNS Zone, Container Registry and
          Kubernetes Service.

          The diagram represents the architecture of the ELAN Web Application,
          which is hosted on Microsoft Azure and deployed using Azure Kubernetes
          Service (AKS). Below is an analysis of how the system works:

          <ul>
            <li>
              A User/Client accesses the web application via HTTPS by visiting
              elanguages.site.
            </li>
            <li>
              The request is resolved through Azure DNS Zone and directed to an
              AKS Load Balancer.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Load Balancer routes the request to the Ingress Controller,
              which manages incoming traffic and directs it to the appropriate
              service within the Azure AKS Cluster.

          <h2>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h2>
          <p>
            Our CI/CD pipeline is powered by GitHub Actions and is designed to
            automatically build, test, and deploy our application whenever
            changes are merged into the <code>main</code> branch. This process
            ensures that the latest code is continuously delivered to our Azure
            Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with minimal downtime.
          </p>

          <h3>Pipeline Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The pipeline is triggered on any push to the
            <code>main</code> branch and performs the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Source Code Checkout and Setup:</strong>
              <br />
              The pipeline begins by checking out the source code from our
              repository using the <code>actions/checkout</code> action. For the
              front-end application (a Single-Page Application), Node.js
              (version 22) is set up using <code>actions/setup-node</code> to
              facilitate the build process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Docker Image Builds:</strong>
              <br />
              We build separate Docker images for each component of our
              application:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>API:</em> Built from the <code>ELAN.Api</code> folder.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>ESOLANG API:</em> Built from the
                  <code>Elan.Api.Esolang</code> folder.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>SITE (Front-End):</em> Built from the
                  <code>FrontEnd</code> folder.
                </li>
              </ul>
              The build commands use the respective Dockerfiles in these
              directories as the build context, ensuring that all necessary
              files are available during the build.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secure Azure Authentication:</strong>
              <br />
              To interact with Azure, the pipeline logs in using Microsoft Entra
              App registration. The sensitive credentials—including the client
              ID, tenant ID, and subscription ID—are stored securely as GitHub
              repository secrets. This secure method allows the pipeline to
              authenticate with Azure without exposing credentials in the code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Azure Container Registry (ACR) Login and Image Push:</strong
              >
              <br />
              After the images are built, the pipeline logs into our ACR using
              the <code>docker/login-action</code>. The ACR username and
              password are also stored as GitHub secrets. Once authenticated,
              the new Docker images are pushed to the registry, ensuring that
              the latest versions are available for deployment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deployment to AKS:</strong>
              <br />
              The pipeline then sets the context for our AKS cluster using the
              <code>azure/aks-set-context</code> action—again, utilizing our
              secure credentials. Finally, it applies the Kubernetes manifests
              (located in the <code>devops/k8s</code> directory) using
              <code>kubectl apply</code>. This updates our deployments,
              services, and ingress configurations, triggering a rolling update
              in AKS.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Optimizations and Conditional Triggers</h3>
          <p>
            To avoid unnecessary builds, the pipeline can be configured to
            trigger only when changes are made to relevant parts of the
            repository (for example, the application source code or Kubernetes
            manifests). This is accomplished using GitHub Actions’
            <code>paths</code> filters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, our Kubernetes Deployments are configured with rolling
            update strategies and health checks, ensuring that new pods are
            fully ready before old ones are terminated—thus minimizing any
            potential downtime during deployment.
          </p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>In summary, our CI/CD pipeline leverages GitHub Actions to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Securely connect to Azure using secrets and a Service Principal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build Docker images for multiple microservices and push them to
              Azure Container Registry.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deploy the updated images to our AKS cluster with zero or minimal
              downtime using rolling updates.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This fully automated process ensures that any changes merged into
            the main branch are quickly and safely deployed, keeping our
            production environment up-to-date while maintaining security and
            efficiency.

            interactions, efficient caching, and improved performance while
            providing a smooth user experience.

          <p>
            For example, elanguages.site/sparql, the query console page uses
            useSessionStorage that makes sure that the query and response
            remains stored on the user's session. Meaning that going from page
            to page won't erase that data.

          <img src="./Scholarly HTML_files/11.png" />
          <p>
            When sending a query from the console, if the API is still
            processing the previous request, the client won't be able to
            repeatedly send other queries.

          <img src="./Scholarly HTML_files/12.png" />
          <p>
            Requests errors are handled depending on their type of error. When
            sending a bad query a warning about its error will pop up.

        <h3>Back-end</h3>
        <p>The project consists of two core microservices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Elan.Api.Esolang:</strong> Handles queries related to
            esoteric programming languages, leveraging SPARQL to fetch data from
            external sources like Wikidata.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ELAN.Api:</strong> Similar in structure, it supports related
            operations with a focus on RDF-based models and linked data
            principles.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <section id="anotherstuff">
          <h4>SPARQL and RDF Integration</h4>
          <p>
            To effectively manage semantic data, the services integrate an RDF
            library that facilitates SPARQL querying and RDF data manipulation.
            The <code>SparqlRepository</code> uses this library to interface
            with external RDF data sources such as Wikidata. The RDF library
            ensures compatibility with linked data principles, enabling the
            system to work with ontologies, taxonomies, and vocabularies.
          </p>

          <p>An example of a SPARQL query is shown below:</p>
          <pre><code>public static string GetEntityDescription(string entityId) => @"
          SELECT ?propertyLabel ?propertyDescription WHERE {
              wd:{entityId} rdfs:label ?propertyLabel;
                     schema:description ?propertyDescription.
              FILTER(LANG(?propertyLabel) = 'en')
              FILTER(LANG(?propertyDescription) = 'en')
          }";</code></pre>

          <p>
            The integration with the RDF library allows for efficient query
            execution and data retrieval. The
            <code>ISparqlRepository</code> interface defines methods such as
            <code>ExecuteQuery</code> to handle complex queries, ensuring that
            semantic data can be queried, transformed, and cached according to
            business needs.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="brrr">
          <h4>Design Patterns and Folder Structure</h4>
          <p>
            The microservices follow a clean architecture with the following
            folder structure:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Controllers:</strong> Define API endpoints (e.g.,
              <code>EntityController.cs</code>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Models:</strong> Represent data structures (e.g.,
              <code>EntityDetails.cs</code>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repositories:</strong> Handle data access and querying
              logic, such as the <code>SparqlRepository</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Services:</strong> Contain business logic, including data
              filtering and caching (e.g., <code>EsolangService.cs</code>).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> Stores models.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This organization promotes separation of concerns and scalability.

        <section id="brrrr">
          <h4>Service Initialization and Dependency Injection</h4>
          <p>
            The services are initialized with dependency injection in the
            <code>Program.cs</code> file:
          </p>
          <pre><code>builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;ISparqlRepository, SparqlRepository&gt;();
      builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IWikidataService, WikidataService&gt;();
      builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;EsolangService&gt;();</code></pre>
          <p>
            The <code>EsolangService</code> initializes cached data on startup
            to enhance performance by avoiding repeated queries.
          </p>

        <section id="brrrrr">
          <h4>Docker and AKS Integration</h4>
          <p>
            The project uses Docker for containerization and Azure Kubernetes
            Service (AKS) for deployment. The Docker setup employs a multi-stage
            build process:
          </p>
          <pre><code># Base stage for runtime
      FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
      USER $APP_UID
      WORKDIR /app
      EXPOSE 8080
      EXPOSE 8081
      
      # Build stage
      FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
      ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
      WORKDIR /src
      COPY ["Elan.Api.Esolang.csproj", "."]

      WORKDIR /app
      COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
      ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Elan.Api.Esolang.dll"]</code></pre>

          <p>
            To deploy on AKS, Kubernetes YAML files are used to define
            deployment and service configurations:

        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <p>
          The REST API endpoints in the ELAN system adhere to several best
          practices for designing, implementing, and maintaining robust and
          scalable APIs. Below is a general overview of these best practices:
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>RESTful Design Principles</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Resource-Oriented: Each endpoint is designed around resources (e.g.,
          esolang entities, filters) and uses HTTP methods (GET, POST)
          appropriately to perform operations on these resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Statelessness: Each request contains all the information needed to
          process it, ensuring the server does not maintain client state between
          requests.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Caching for Performance Optimization</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Responses for frequently accessed data (e.g., esolang entities and
          filters) are cached to reduce redundant computation and improve
          performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Caching is implemented using IMemoryCache in .NET, with a defined
          expiration time (e.g., 1 day).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Separation of Concerns</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The API is divided into controllers, services, and repositories, each
          with a specific responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Services and repositories are injected into controllers, promoting
          loose coupling and testability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Flexibility and Extensibility</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The use of microservices and containerization (e.g., Docker,
          Kubernetes) allows the API to scale horizontally as demand grows.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="UseCases">
      <h2>User guide</h2>
      <p>
        When accessing https://elanguages.site/ the user will be redirected to
        https://elanguages.site/home where he will see the main page of the
        application.
      </p>
      <img src="./Scholarly HTML_files/image.png" width="1200px" />
      <p>
        On the top right there are the 3 modules of the application: Home,
        Presentation, SPARQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the current page we can see a network of esoteric languages. All
        esoteric languages (dark blue) are connected to the central node
        EPL(light blue). Each esoteric language is connected to properties(light
        green), and each property is connected to values(dark green) of said
        property.
      </p>
      <img src="./Scholarly HTML_files/2.png" />
      <p>
        See Values button on the top left is used to hide the dark green values
        in order to read the network easily.
      </p>
      <img src="./Scholarly HTML_files/3.png" />
      <p>
        The filters button will pop the filters by which the users can choose
        his language. Here we can find 3 other button that the user can use for
        resetting, filtering or to get recommendations about languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        By left-clicking on a node it will take the users to the entity page of
        the chosen entity or to the wikidata page of the chosen property.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some quick filtering we added a right-click functionality. Once a
        node gets right-clicked it will create a new network with all the roads
        that have that node in common.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the SPARQL module the user will be met with a query console. Based on
        the user's query he will get information structured in a table like
        manner.
      </p>
